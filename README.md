# Bankruptcy-Prediction-system
This system aims to predict whether a company is likely to go bankrupt in the future. Think of it like a financial early warning system. By analyzing a company's financial data, the system tries to identify patterns and indicators that suggest a higher risk of failure.
The system uses a company's financial information – things like their profits, debts, assets, and cash flow – to make its predictions. Here's a simplified breakdown of the process:

Data Collection: The system starts with a dataset of financial information from various companies. This data includes companies that eventually went bankrupt and companies that remained healthy.

Feature Selection: Not all financial data is equally important for predicting bankruptcy. This step involves identifying the most relevant financial indicators (or "features") that have the strongest relationship with a company's financial health. For example, the amount of debt compared to assets might be a crucial indicator.

Model Training: A machine learning model (think of it as a sophisticated algorithm or a "brain") is trained using the historical financial data. This model learns the patterns and relationships between the selected financial features and whether a company ultimately went bankrupt or not. Different types of models can be used, such as:

Logistic Regression: A statistical method that estimates the probability of an event occurring (in this case, bankruptcy).

Decision Trees/Random Forests: Models that make predictions based on a series of "if-then-else" rules learned from the data.

Support Vector Machines (SVM): A model that finds the best way to separate bankrupt companies from non-bankrupt companies in the financial data.

Prediction: Once the model is trained, you can feed it the financial data of a new company. The model will then analyze this data based on what it has learned and output a prediction – usually a probability or a classification (e.g., "high risk of bankruptcy" or "low risk of bankruptcy").

Key Components

Financial Data: This is the raw material the system works with. It includes various financial ratios and indicators.

Features: These are the selected, most important financial indicators used for prediction.

Machine Learning Model: This is the core of the system, the algorithm that learns from the data and makes predictions.

In Simple Terms

Imagine a doctor trying to predict if a patient is at risk of a heart attack. The doctor looks at various factors like blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and family history. Similarly, this bankruptcy prediction system looks at a company's financial "vitals" to assess its risk of failure. By learning from the financial data of companies that have gone bankrupt in the past, the system can identify warning signs in new companies and predict potential bankruptcy. This can be valuable for investors, lenders, and the companies themselves to take necessary actions.
